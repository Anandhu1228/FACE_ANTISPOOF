# FACE_ANTISPOOF

The FACE_ANTISPOOF model is a lightweight, quantized anti-spoofing model trained on approximately 120,000 images to detect attendance fraud using printed photos and digital screen replays (such as from phones or laptops). It does not handle more complex spoofing methods like 3D masks. The model uses YOLO for face detection and EfficientNet as the classification backbone. During training, face crops included the entire head region as extracted by the YOLO detector. For mobile deployment, the FaceAPI Tiny YOLO model is used for face detection, which typically detects only the forehead region. To ensure compatibility with the EfficientNet model, the client-side implementation must scale the detected forehead region to approximate a full-head crop before passing it to the classifier. This adjustment is necessary to align with the training data distribution and maintain model accuracy during real-time inference on mobile devices.
